- `display: block`   
  - Element will take up the entire width.
  - Adds new line above and below to element. So no side by side elements.
  - Can set width, height to the element.
  - `div` is by default display `block`.

- `display: inline`
    - Element take the minimum amount of width (space) as possible to fit the content inside.
    - Elements fit together side by side.
    - Can't set width, height to the element.
    - `span` is by default display `inline`.

- `display: inline-block`
  - Same behaviours as `inline`
  - But can set width, height to the element.

- `display: none`
  - Acts as if element is completely deleted from the HTML.
  - No space is taken.
